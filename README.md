# Simple Calculator

## Project Description
This is a simple command-line calculator built in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user can select an operation and input two numbers to get the result.

## Features
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division
- Input validation to prevent division by zero
- Easy-to-use command-line interface

## How to Use
1. Run the Python script.
2. Select an operation by entering the corresponding letter (A for Add, B for Subtract, C for Multiply, D for Divide).
3. Enter two numbers.
4. The program displays the result.

## Code Structure
The program consists of the following functions:
- add(x, y): Returns the sum of `x` and `y`.
- subtract(x, y): Returns the difference between `x` and `y`.
- multiply(x, y): Returns the product of `x` and `y`.
- divide(x, y): Returns the quotient of `x` divided by `y`, with a check for division by zero.
- calculator(): Main function to handle user interaction and call the appropriate operation.

## Example Usage
Select operation:
A. Add
B. Subtract
C. Multiply
D. Divide
Enter choice (A/B/C/D): A
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 3
Result: 8.0
